## 🔍 Project Overview
Successfully implemented and tested a UART communication system on an FPGA using Verilog, leveraging existing modules with custom modifications. Utilized Quartus Lite for FPGA development and integrated Raspberry Pi for data input.

## 🔧 Key Responsibilities
- 📚 Research and Selection: Identified and reviewed existing Verilog RTL for UART transceivers, selecting a suitable design for modification and implementation.
- 💻 Implementation: Modified existing UART transmitter and receiver modules to meet project specifications, ensuring compatibility with the FPGA architecture.
- 🛠️ Testbench Development: Created a comprehensive Verilog testbench to simulate and validate the functionality of both transmitter and receiver modules under various conditions.
- 🔗 Integration: Connected the UART system with a Raspberry Pi for data transmission, ensuring seamless communication.
- 🔄 Simulation and Verification: Conducted extensive simulations to verify UART operation, addressing edge cases.
- 🚀 FPGA Deployment: Synthesized, placed, routed, and programmed the design onto the FPGA, validating the final implementation with real-world data transmission.

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies
- Verilog HDL
- Quartus Lite
- ModelSim for simulation
- Raspberry Pi
