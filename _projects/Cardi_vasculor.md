## Key Features
- **Data Exploration**: Comprehensive analysis to understand the dataset's structure and distribution.
- **Feature Engineering**: Introduced new features like Body Mass Index (BMI) and conducted age normalization.
- **Data Cleaning**: Applied the Interquartile Range (IQR) method to remove outliers.
- **Modeling**: Utilized a Voting Classifier that combines KNN, Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest algorithms.
- **Evaluation**: Attained a high accuracy score and generated a detailed classification report.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Kaggle
- **Size**: Initially 70,000 records, reduced to 62,745 after data cleaning
- **Attributes**: Age, gender, blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), cholesterol level, glucose level, smoking and alcohol habits, physical activity level, and cardiovascular disease status.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Kaggle Docker Image

## Results
- **Accuracy**: Achieved 99% accuracy on the test dataset using the Voting Classifier.
- **Insights**: Provided valuable insights into key factors contributing to cardiovascular disease.
- **Performance**: Highlighted the significance of data preprocessing and feature engineering in enhancing model performance.
