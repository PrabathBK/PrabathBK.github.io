## Overview

This project features a robot model equipped with:

- 🛰️ **Lidar**
- 📸 **Stereo Camera as a Depth Camera**

Using these sensors, the robot can map a room and navigate from one location to another while avoiding obstacles with SLAM and Nav2.

### Here is a video demonstrating the project:

## Branches

### 🌍 Main Branch: Mapping and Navigation

- Collects environmental data using sensors and navigates the robot from one location to another, avoiding obstacles along the way.

### 🎾 Object Tracking Branch

- The robot tracks a tennis ball using OpenCV object detection.

## Usage

- **Mapping a Room**:

  1. Move the robot around to create a map.
  2. Save the generated map.

- **Navigation**:

  1. Load the saved map.
  2. Set a goal location.
  3. The robot will navigate to the goal while avoiding obstacles.

- **Object Tracking**:
  1. Switch to the `ObjectTracking` branch.
  2. Launch the object tracking node.
  3. The robot will track a tennis ball in the environment.
