## 📝 Description
Developed an industrial-grade portable water quality measuring device capable of accurately measuring four key parameters: pH, Turbidity, Conductivity, and Temperature. The device integrates sensor probes with signal processing modules on a single PCB, ensuring impedance and frequency matching for precise measurements. Data is seamlessly transmitted to Google Firebase Realtime Database using ESP for real-time monitoring and analysis. The device features a waterproof enclosure for durability in various environmental conditions.

## 🎯 Project Goals
To design and deploy a compact, robust, and user-friendly device for on-site water quality monitoring in industrial settings. The primary objectives were to ensure accurate measurement, seamless data transmission, and easy accessibility of results for users.
