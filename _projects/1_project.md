## Hydrolink: The Innovative IoT Device Revolutionizing Water Tank Management

Hydrolink is a project we developed during our Engineering Design Project in the 2nd semester. It is designed to convert any existing water tank into a smart, efficient system, providing real-time monitoring and control without causing any damage to the existing structure.

## Key Features

- **🔍 Real-Time Water Level Monitoring:** Monitor water levels using a mobile app from anywhere in the world.

- **⚙️ Automatic & Manual Water Flow Control:** Hydrolink allows complete control at your fingertips, whether automating irrigation or manually adjusting water flow.

- **💨 Air Flow Detection:** Advanced sensors detect unwanted air flows, ensuring your water remains clean and free from contamination.

- **🔋 Backup Batteries for Power Cuts:** Equipped with backup batteries to ensure uninterrupted operation, even during power outages.

With Hydrolink, we’re not just creating a product; we’re empowering communities to manage their water resources efficiently and sustainably.

**💧 Join us in shaping a future where every drop counts.**

We developed Hydrolink as a comprehensive IoT solution and received funding from the World Bank for this project under UBLC. Our team is currently working on improvements to make it market-ready.
