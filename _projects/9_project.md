#### Manufacturing and Assembly Line Planning and Management Subsystem for PCB Manufacturing Company

## Description
üîß In my fourth semester, I was part of a team that developed a web application for an electronic circuit manufacturing company, focusing specifically on the Manufacturing and Assembly Line Planning and Management subsystem to streamline warehouse operations.

### Subsystems:

**Manufacturing**: This subsystem handles the manufacturing processes within the warehouse.

## Project Goals
üéØ Our aim was to enhance the manufacturing process efficiency through a solution that integrated seamlessly with other modules like inventory management, quality assurance, and human resource management.

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Java Spring Boot
- **Frontend:** React.js with Vite
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Version Control:** GitHub
- **API Testing:** Postman
- **API management:** Axios

In this project, I focused on backend development, database management, API management, and also contributed to some frontend development parts.

## Key Features
- **Worker and Admin Login:** Implemented secure sign-in/out processes and role management.
- **Order Management:** Integrated with the Customer Order Management System to fetch new orders.
- **Manufacturing Workflow:** Managed orders through various workstations and updated statuses.
- **Buffer Management:** Managed buffer zones between substations to optimize workflow.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Enabled real-time tracking of operations via the admin interface.
- **Order Completion:** Ensured completed orders were passed efficiently to the Quality Assurance subsystem.

## Outcome
üèÜ The project was successfully completed, delivering a functional subsystem that met all client specifications. It demonstrated adaptability, extendability, and effective integration within the company‚Äôs broader ecosystem.

This project not only boosted my backend and frontend development skills but also enriched my experience in collaborative software development.

## Goal

Our aim was to enhance the manufacturing process efficiency through a solution that integrated seamlessly with other modules like inventory management, quality assurance, and human resource management.


## Project Setup Steps

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the project repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PrabathBK/CompanyB.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the backend directory and run the backend server using IntelliJ IDEA:

    ```bash
    cd CompanyB
    # Run backend using IntelliJ IDEA
    ```

3. Navigate to the frontend directory:

    ```bash
    cd FrontendPrabath
    ```

4. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    npm i
    ```

5. Start the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

6. Open a web browser and go to [http://localhost:5173/companyB/manufacturing/](http://localhost:5173/companyB/manufacturing/) to access the manufacturing subsystem.
