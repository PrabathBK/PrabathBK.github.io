## 🎯 Objective

Our mission was to design a Portable Audio Amplifier using only analog components. Our device is capable of amplifying audio input from any audio-generating device through three main sub-circuits: preamplifier, tone controller, and power amplifier. By leveraging the Baxandall passive tone-controller, we successfully implemented volume, bass, and treble controls, ensuring optimal audio customization.
