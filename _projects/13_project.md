## Description
**Steer Safe** is a device that utilizes machine learning and electrooculography (EOG) signals to track a driver's state of awareness in real-time. It provides early alerts to potentially save lives by monitoring the driver's attention levels.

Currently, this project is undergoing the IP process. If you need more details, feel free to contact me.
